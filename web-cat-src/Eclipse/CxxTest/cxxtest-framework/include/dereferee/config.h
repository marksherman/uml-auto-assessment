/*
 * Each of the following is a feature of Dereferee that requires conditional
 * compilation to be cleanly supported or gracefully omitted on various
 * compilers. If your compiler is not listed here, you can add it by using
 * preprocessor macros to detect its existence and version, and enabling or
 * disabling the features that the compiler supports.
 *
 * If you are adding support for a compiler here, make sure to also look
 * inside cookie_calculator.h and see if you need to make any adjustments
 * there to support your compiler. (This is particularly true if your
 * compiler supports the TR1 traits extensions, which provide a much more
 * robust method for cookie calculation.)

/*
 * DEREFEREE_CONFIG_ENHANCED_DECLARATION
 * Value: defined/undefined
 *
 * Does the compiler support variadic macros? If so, we allow declaration of
 * checked pointers to take the form checked(T*). If not, clients must use the
 * checked pointer class directly, in the form checked_ptr<T*>.
 *
 * ----
 * DEREFEREE_THROW_BAD_ALLOC
 * Value: throw(std::bad_alloc)/undefined
 *
 * Does the compiler support exception specifications? If so, we indicate that
 * operator new and various helper methods can throw std::bad_alloc using an
 * exception specification. For compilers that ignore these, we use an empty
 * definition to leave it out.
 *
 * ----
 * DEREFEREE_NO_DYNAMIC_CAST
 * Value: defined/undefined
 *
 * Does the compiler support partial template specializations well enough to
 * use our redefinition of the dynamic_cast operator? If not, define this and
 * those definitions will not be included; however, any code that passes a
 * checked_ptr<T*> to dynamic_cast will first have to explicitly cast it back
 * to T*.
 *
 * ----
 * DEREFEREE_NO_CONST_CAST
 * Value: defined/undefined
 *
 * Does the compiler support partial template specializations well enough to
 * use our redefinition of the const_cast operator? If not, define this and
 * those definitions will not be included; however, any code that passes a
 * checked_ptr<T*> to const_cast will first have to explicitly cast it back
 * to T*.
 *
 * ----
 * DEREFEREE_STRTOK
 * Value: strtok_r/strtok_s
 *
 * Which strtok function does this compiler support?  On Unix, Mac OS X, and
 * Cygwin, we use strtok_r. On Microsoft Visual C++, we use strtok_s.
