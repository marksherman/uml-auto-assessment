<h1>Creating a New CxxTest Project</h1>

<p><img class="right" src="images/NewProjectWizard.gif" alt="New C++ Project
Wizard"/>To create a CxxTest project in Eclipse, select <b>File / New / Project...</b>
from the main menu, expand the <b>C++</b> branch of the tree, then select
<b>C++ Project</b> and click <b>Next</b>.</p>

<p>If the CxxTest plug-ins are properly
installed, you should be able to expand the <b>Executable</b> branch under 
"Project types:" and see an entry labeled <b>Empty Project w/ CxxTest</b>.
Select this option, and enter the name of the new project in the field at the
top of the wizard &mdash; for this tutorial, enter <code>BankAccount</code>.</p>

<p>You can now click <b>Finish</b> at this point to create the project &mdash;
the remaining pages of the wizard have advanced options, and we will want to
keep the default settings.</p>

<p>After the project has been created, Eclipse may ask you, <i>"This kind of project is associated
with the C/C++ Perspective. Do you want to switch to this perspective now?"</i>  Click <b>Yes</b>
here.</p>

<p class="caution"><b>NOTE:</b> If you create a project without the CxxTest
option, it is still possible to enable CxxTest for the project later by viewing
the project properties page, selecting the <b>CxxTest</b> category, and then
checking the box labeled "Enable CxxTest for this project".</p>

<h1>Creating the Class to Test</h1>
<p>The new project should appear in your Eclipse workspace, in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab.
Before we can start writing test cases, clearly we need a class that we want to test.  For
this tutorial, consider a simple bank account class that holds a name and a dollar amount, and
supports the following operations:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Construct</b> an empty bank account with $0</li>
	<li><b>Construct</b> a bank account with a specified amount</li>
	<li><b>Deposit</b> an amount into the account</li>
	<li><b>Withdraw</b> an amount from the account</li>
	<li>Access a value containing the <b>current balance</b></li>
	<li>Access a value specifying whether the account is <b>overdrawn</b> (negative balance)</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="right" src="images/NewHeaderFile.gif" alt="Creating a new header file from the context menu"/>
The bank account class we will be using is very limited.  We store an integer dollar amount instead
of dollars and cents or fractions of a dollar, because a floating-point type would have problems
when checking for equality, which we need to be able to do in our test cases to verify that the
balance is what we expect it to be after an operation.  (Your C++ text should have more
information on floating-point types and the comparison problems that are associated with them.)
</p>

<p>Let's begin by adding the <code>BankAccount</code> class that
we wish to use in our tests.  Right-click on the top-level project ("BankAccount") in the Project
Explorer, and choose <b>New / Header File</b> from the popup menu.  In the dialog that appears, type
<code>BankAccount.h</code> as the name of the file and click <b>Finish</b>.</p>

<p>This has created a new <code>BankAccount.h</code> file in the main directory of our project, and
the file was automatically opened in the editor.  You will see that Eclipse has already added a
few lines of code to the file. These "inclusion guards" are used to prevent a header file from
being included multiple times while compiling a single C++ source file. Now, add the interface for our
bank account class by copying and pasting the code below into the new file.</p>

<div class="block"><pre>
<span class="comment">// BankAccount.h</span>

<span class="keyword">#ifndef</span> BANKACCOUNT_H_
<span class="keyword">#define</span> BANKACCOUNT_H_

<span class="keyword">#include</span> <span class="header">&lt;string&gt;</span>

<span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="classname">BankAccount</span>
{
<span class="keyword">private:</span>
    std::string <span class="field">accountHolder</span>;
    <span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="field">balance</span>;
    
<span class="keyword">public:</span>
    <span class="comment">// Constructors</span>
    <span class="method">BankAccount</span>( <span class="keyword">const char</span>* holder, <span class="keyword">int</span> initialBalance = 0 );

    <span class="comment">// Accessors</span>
    <span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="method">getBalance</span>() <span class="keyword">const</span>;

    <span class="comment">// Modifiers</span>

};

<span class="keyword">#endif</span> <span class="comment">/*BANKACCOUNT_H_*/</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Next, we need to add the implementation of these functions.  Create new source file in the
root of the project by right-clicking on the project and choosing <b>New / Source File</b>, and
call the new file <code>BankAccount.cpp</code>.  Copy the following code
into this new file.</p>
<div class="block"><pre>
<span class="comment">// BankAccount.cpp</span>

<span class="keyword">#include</span> <span class="string">"BankAccount.h"</span>

<span class="keyword">#include</span> <span class="header">&lt;string&gt;</span>

<span class="keyword">using namespace</span> std;

<span class="comment">// Initializes a new account with the specified account holder name
// and initial balance.  If the initial balance is omitted, it defaults
// to zero.</span>
<span class="method">BankAccount::BankAccount</span>( <span class="keyword">const char</span>* holder, <span class="keyword">int</span> initialBalance )
{
    <span class="field">accountHolder</span> = holder;
    <span class="field">balance</span> = initialBalance;
}

<span class="comment">// Returns the current balance in the account.</span>
<span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="method">BankAccount::getBalance</span>() <span class="keyword">const</span>
{
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="field">balance</span>;
}

<span class="comment">// Returns true if the account is overdrawn (has a negative balance);
// otherwise, it returns false.</span>
<span class="keyword">bool</span> <span class="method">BankAccount::isOverdrawn</span>() <span class="keyword">const</span>
{
    return (<span class="field">balance</span> &lt; 0);
}

<span class="comment">// Adds the specified amount to the balance in the account.</span>
<span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="method">BankAccount::deposit</span>( <span class="keyword">int</span> value )

}

<span class="comment">// Subtracts the specified amount from the balance in the account.</span>
<span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="method">BankAccount::withdraw</span>( <span class="keyword">int</span> value )
{
    <span class="field">balance</span> -= value;
}
</pre></div>

<p><img class="right" src="images/BuildButton.gif" alt="Build a project by clicking this button on the toolbar"/>
We now have a complete <code>BankAccount</code> class that we can compile and test.
Unlike working on Java projects in Eclipse, you must explicitly compile your C++ projects
each time you make a change to one of your source files. To do this, click on the <b>Build</b>
button (shaped like a hammer, shown right) in the toolbar.</p>

<p>If you followed this instructions correctly, your project should build without
errors. Since the test cases in a project are executed each time the project is
built, the <b>CxxTest</b> view should appear and be empty, reflecting that
no test cases have yet been written. We will write a test class in the next step.</p>

<h1>Creating the Test Cases</h1>

<p>To create our test cases, we need to add a new <code>.h</code> header file to our
project that will contain a special class that derives from one in the CxxTest library.
A special wizard exists to create test suites; right-click on the project root folder and
select <b>New / CxxTest Suite</b>.</p>

<p>In the New CxxTest Suite Wizard, enter <code>BankAccountTests</code> as the name of
the test suite class that will be generated. You can also choose the header file, if
any, that contains the class or classes that you wish to test. Click the <b>Browse...</b>
button to the right of the "Header under test:" field, then expand the <code>BankAccount</code>
project, select <code>BankAccount.h</code>, and click <b>OK</b>.</p>

<p>If you click <b>Next</b> at this point, you will be presented with a tree view of
all of the global functions, classes, and methods that are declared in the header file
that you chose to test. This allows you to automatically generated function placeholders
for all of the functions that you wish to write test cases for.  For the purposes of
this tutorial, we will be writing test cases manually, so click <b>Finish</b> to dismiss
the wizard.</p>

<p>The newly generated test suite file should look like the following snippet:</p>

<div class="block"><pre>
<span class="keyword">#ifndef</span> BANKACCOUNTTESTS_H_
<span class="keyword">#define</span> BANKACCOUNTTESTS_H_

<span class="keyword">#include</span> <span class="header">&lt;cxxtest/TestSuite.h&gt;</span>

<span class="keyword">#include</span> <span class="header">"BankAccount.h"</span>

<span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="classname">BankAccountTest</span> : <span class="keyword">public</span> CxxTest::<span class="classname">TestSuite</span>
{
<span class="keyword">public</span>:
};

<span class="keyword">#endif</span> <span class="comment">/*BANKACCOUNTTESTS_H_*/</span>
</pre></div>

<p>There are several points of interest here.  We include the <code>&lt;cxxtest/TestSuite.h&gt;</code>
header to make available the definition of the <code>CxxTest::TestSuite</code> class, from
which all test case classes must inherit.  Additionally, we must obviously include the
header for the <code>BankAccount</code> class that we are testing.</p>

<p>Before we begin to add test cases to this class, there are a couple coding conventions
that you must follow when writing test cases.
A method that is intended to be executed as a test case must have a name that begins with
<code>test</code>, a return type of <code class="keyword">void</code>, and takes no
arguments. If you do not follow these rules, the function will not be recognized as a
test case by CxxTest and it will not be executed.</p>

<p>Now we will add a series of methods to the class that perform various operations and
tests.  First we will create a simple test that verifies that the <code>BankAccount</code>
constructor works as expected.  Add the following method under the
<code class="keyword">public</code> modifier:</p>

<div class="block"><pre>
    <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="method">testInitialBalances</span>()
    {
        <span class="comment">// An account initialized with a name only should start
        // empty.</span>
        BankAccount emptyAccount( <span class="string">"Empty Account"</span> );
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( emptyAccount.getBalance(), 0 );
        
        <span class="comment">// An account initialized with a balance should obviously
        // have that balance.</span>
        BankAccount nonemptyAccount( <span class="string">"Nonempty Account"</span>, 12345 );
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( nonemptyAccount.getBalance(), 12345 );
    }
</pre></div>

<p>This method creates a new <code>BankAccount</code> object, first with the balance omitted,
so it should default to zero.  We use the special <code>TS_ASSERT_EQUALS</code> directive from
CxxTest to verify this.  <code>TS_ASSERT_EQUALS</code> takes two parameters and verifies that
both are equal.</p>

<p>The second half of the function creates an account with an initial balance and verifies
that the balance was set properly.</p>

<p>Notice that we defined this method inside the header file, instead of creating a separate
source file to contain the method bodies. This is an example of <i>inlining</i> a function,
and we do it here for simplicity &mdash; typically when writing test cases, there is no need
to introduce extra complexity into the project by separating them into <code>.h</code> and
<code>.cpp</code> files.

<p><img class="right" src="images/SuccessfulRun.gif" alt="Successful Test Run"/>
Save the file and build the project.  If everything performed properly, the
test cases should run automatically and the <b>CxxTest</b> view will appear as
shown to the right.</p>

<p>The green progress bar indicates that all tests executed successfully. The
<b>BankAccountTest</b> test suite is collapsed because only tests with errors are
expanded by default.

<p>We can now add a few more test cases to the file.  Try adding the following methods:</p>

<div class="block"><pre>
    <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="method">testDeposits</span>()
    {
        <span class="comment">// Start Joe out poor, with $0.00.</span>
        BankAccount account( <span class="string">"Joe Hokie"</span> );
        
        <span class="comment">// Deposit $5.00 in his account.</span>
        account.deposit( 5 );
        
        <span class="comment">// Hopefully the bank is keeping track of his money properly.</span>
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( account.getBalance(), 5 );
        
        <span class="comment">// Have Joe deposit a little more, and verify.</span>
        account.deposit( 100 );
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( account.getBalance(), 105 );
    }
    
    <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="method">testWithdrawals</span>()
    {
        <span class="comment">// Start Francois out moderately wealthy.</span>
        BankAccount account( <span class="string">"Francois Hokie"</span>, 5000 );
        
        <span class="comment">// Francois is a big spender, who makes several withdrawals.</span>
        account.withdraw( 100 );
        account.withdraw( 200 );
        account.withdraw( 300 );
        account.withdraw( 400 );
        account.withdraw( 500 );

        <span class="comment">// He should have $3500 left now.</span>
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS(account.getBalance(), 3500);
    }
    
    <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="method">testVariousActivity</span>()
    {
        <span class="comment">// Start Sabrina out with $75, and then monitor her
        // account over some deposits and withdrawals.</span>
        BankAccount account( <span class="string">"Sabrina Hokie"</span>, 75 );
        
        account.deposit( 50 );
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( account.getBalance(), 125 );

        account.withdraw( 10 );
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( account.getBalance(), 115 );
        
        account.withdraw( 42 );
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( account.getBalance(), 73 );
        
        account.deposit( 534 );
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( account.getBalance(), 607 );
    }
</pre></div>

<p>So far we have only used the <code>TS_ASSERT_EQUALS</code> directive in our tests.
CxxTest supports many others, which you can find in its
<a href="http://cxxtest.sourceforge.net/guide.html#TOC8">user guide</a>.  The ones that
will be most relevant to you in this course are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>TS_ASSERT(expr)</code>: Verifies that the expression <code>expr</code> evaluates to <code>true</code></li>
    <li><code>TS_ASSERT_EQUALS(x, y)</code>: Verifies that the expressions <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are equal</li>
    <li><code>TS_ASSERT_DIFFERS(x, y)</code>: Verifies that the expressions <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are not equal</li>
    <li><code>TS_ASSERT_LESS_THAN(x, y)</code>: Verifies that the expression <code>x</code> is less than <code>y</code></li>
    <li><code>TS_ASSERT_LESS_THAN_EQUALS(x, y)</code>: Verifies that the expression <code>x</code> is less than or equal to <code>y</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Let's create a test case that uses some of these.</p>

<div class="block"><pre>
    <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="method">testOverdrawn</span>()
    {
        <span class="comment">// Hiroyuki isn't very responsible with his money, so
        // he is going to withdraw more than he has available.</span>
        BankAccount account( <span class="string">"Hiroyuki Hokie"</span>, 115 );
        account.withdraw( 200 );
        
        TS_ASSERT_LESS_THAN( account.getBalance(), 0 );
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( account.getBalance(), -85 );
        TS_ASSERT( account.isOverdrawn() );
        
        <span class="comment">// Later, a Wall Street financial expert takes Hiroyuki
        // under his wing and teaches him how to properly manage
        // his funds.  He makes a large deposit to get his life
        // back on track.</span>
        account.deposit( 1000 );
        
        TS_ASSERT_LESS_THAN( 0, account.getBalance() );
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( account.getBalance(), 915 );
        TS_ASSERT( !account.isOverdrawn() );
    }
</pre></div>

<p>If you have copied all of these properly, Eclipse should report that five tests
ran successfully.  But what if a test case failed?  Let's create one that is designed
to fail in order to see the results.  The following test case contains a mathematical
error in its assertion:</p>

<div class="block"><pre>
    <span class="keyword">void</span> testBadCase()
    {
        BankAccount account( <span class="string">"Bad Test Case"</span>, 5 );
        account.deposit( 7 );

        <span class="comment">// To my knowledge, 5 + 7 != 13.</span>
        TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( account.getBalance(), 13 );
    }
</pre></div>

<p>When this test is executed, the <b>CxxTest</b> view will display a test
failure. Failed tests are also flagged with icons in the left margin of the
text editor, on the line containing the failure.</p>

<p><img src="images/FailedTest.gif" alt="An example of a failed test case"/></p>

<p>You can also click on the item in "Details" labeled "Failed assertion" and
Eclipse will open the source file and highlight the line containing the particular
assertion that caused the test case to fail.</p>

<a name="Troubleshooting"></a>
<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>There are several issues that can arise in trying to run the
CxxTest test scripts. In theory, if you follow all of the steps above
exactly as they state, the program should work. However if you are
having trouble, please try the following corrective action. After
checking on the following steps, the CxxTest test scripts should work:</p>

<ol>

  <li><b>Verify that you have an appropriate Java version</b></p>
  <p>Open a command window and execute the command <code>java
  -version</code>.  It should list a version of 1.5.0 or newer.  If it
  lists an older version, make sure that you have properly installed a
  recent version of the Java SDK, and that its bin directory has been
  properly added to your path (see next item for path instructions).</p>

  <li><b>Verify that you have added cygwin to your path correctly</b></p>
  <p>This differs, depending on your OS.  For Windows XP users, 
    go to the Start menu and click on Control Panel.  Click
    Performance and Maintenance, then System.  In the System dialog,
    click the "Advanced" tab, and then click the "Environment
    Variables" button. Look for the PATH entry in the System variables
    section and double-click it.  Make sure that the PATH starts with
    "<code>C:\cygwin\bin;...</code>", where
    <code>C:\cygwin</code> is the path where you installed Cygwin
    (make sure that cygwin is not installed in a directory
    where spaces occur anywhere in the path name).  Restart your
    machine for this change to take full effect.</p>

  <li><p><b>Verify that cygwin is installed properly</b></p>
    <p>Start a regular windows command window, then execute the
    following command:</p>
<pre>
which echo
</pre>
    <p>If your system responds with anything other than
  <code>/usr/bin/echo</code>, then cygwin is not installed correctly.
  Double-check that cygwin is on your path properly.  If so, you may
  need to re-install cygwin.</p>

  <li><p><b>Verify that g++ is installed properly</b></p>
    <p>Start a regular Windows command window, then execute the
    following command:</p>
<pre>
g++ -v
</pre>
    <p>Your system should respond with something similar to:</p>
<pre>

</pre>
    <p>Your g++ version number may be different (a version >=
    3.3.x is preferred).  If your system reponds with any sort
    of error (e.g., "'g++' is not recognized ..."), then repeat
    the cygwin setup in Step 2 above, ensuring that all of the
    items in Step 2.9 are selected before completing the installation.
</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Confirm that you have a runAllTests.cpp file:</b></p>
    <p>The CxxTest builder generates a file called
    <code>runAllTests.cpp</code> within your project each time it
    detects any changes to your test cases.  If you don't have any
    test cases, then add a test class.
    Without any tests, CxxTest won't produce anything.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Verify that CxxTest is enabled for the project:</b></p>
    <p>Right-click on the project's root folder and choose <b>Properties</b>.
    Select the <b>CxxTest</b> branch from the tree and verify that
    "Enable CxxTest for this project" is checked. If it is not, check it,
    click <b>OK</b>, and rebuild your project.</p>
</li>
</ol>
