<h1>Submitting Projects from Eclipse</h1>

<p>To invoke the submission wizard in Eclipse, you will use the following
icon: </p>

<img src="images/submit_icon.gif" alt="submit icon"  title="submit icon"/>

<p>
There are three locations in the user-interface from which you can submit a
project.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The main Eclipse toolbar</li>
<li>The "Submit Project..." item in the "Project" menu</li>
<li>
Right-click a project in the "Package Explorer" or "Navigator" panes and
choose "Submit..."
</li>
</ul>

<h1>The submission wizard</h1>

  title="submission wizard"/>

<p>
The image above shows an example of the submission wizard.  First, choose
the assignment to which you want to submit from the tree. Then enter your
username, and the password (if required) that you use to access the
submission system. Finally, press the "Next &gt;" button to package and
submit the project. A progress indicator will appear at the bottom of the
wizard:
</p>

  alt="the progress indicator in the submission wizard"
  title="the progress indicator in the submission wizard"/>

<p>
Once the submission is complete, the final page of the wizard will show a
summary of the process:
</p>

<img src="images/submit_wizard_3.gif"
  alt="submission wizard summary"
  title="submission wizard summary"/>

<p>
If there were any errors that occurred during submission, they will appear
here.  To dismiss the wizard, press "Finish". At this point, if the external
submission system generated a response (such as a confirmation that the
submission was received successfully, or automatically graded output),
then this will appear in a browser window in the Eclipse editor.
