<h1>Submission Plug-In Preferences</h1>

<p>
Before you can begin using the Eclipse plug-in to submit projects through the
IDE, you need to enter some information into the Eclipse preferences. To
access the plug-in settings, choose <em>Window/Preferences...</em> from the
Eclipse main menu and select <em>Electronic Submission</em> from the tree.
The preferences page will look something like the following:
</p>
<img src="images/preferences.gif"
  alt="preferences dialog"
  title="preferences dialog"/>

<h1>Settings</h1>

<p>
The Web-CAT plug-in preferences page has four fields that the user can specify.
The first field is required--the other three are optional.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Assignment definition URL:</strong> This is the URL to the XML file
that contains the assignment definitions. This URL can use any protocol to
which Java can open a connection and read data--<tt>http</tt> and
<tt>file</tt> are likely to be the most common. Note that if a local file is
to be used, you must use the <tt>file</tt> protocol--entering only the path
to the file is not sufficient.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Default username:</strong> This property is a convenience for the
user--the username specified here will be automatically entered in the
submission wizard when it is opened. The user can still enter a different
username at that point, if he or she wishes to do so.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Outgoing (SMTP) mail server:</strong> The outgoing mail server that
should be used to submit assignments that use the <tt>mailto</tt> protocol
in their transports. If you do not intend to use <tt>mailto</tt> transports,
then you may leave this field blank.
</li>

<li>
<strong>E-mail address:</strong> The e-mail address from which mail should be
sent when submitting to assignments that use the <tt>mailto</tt> protocol.
This will typically be the student's e-mail address. As with the previous
field, if no <tt>mailto</tt> transports are being used, this field can be
left blank.
</li>
</ul>
