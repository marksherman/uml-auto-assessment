/**
 * <p>Represents a value-returning action with an associated editing context,
 * that has built-in support for locking, unlocking, and disposing of the
 * editing context.
 * </p><p>
 * Basic usage is:</p>
 * <pre>
 * import org.webcat.woextensions.ECActionWithResult;
 * import static org.webcat.woextensions.ECActionWithResult.call;
 *
 * ...
 *
 * int x = call(new ECActionWithResult<Integer>() { public Integer action() {
 *
 *     // place your actions here
 *     // use "ec" to refer to the action's editing context
 *
 *     return ...;
 * }});
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * When used like this, a new editing context is created and locked just
 * for this action, and then unlocked and disposed when the action
 * completes.  If you have an existing editing context that you wish
 * to reuse for multiple actions, you can pass it into the constructor,
 * along with a boolean that indicates whether or not to dispose of the
 * context when the action completes:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * run(new ECAction(myEC, false) { public void action() {
 *
 *     // place your actions here
 *     // use "ec" to refer to the action's editing context, which equals myEC
 *
 * }});
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Inside classes that define their own run() methods, you cannot statically
 * import run(), as in the examples above.  In those cases, you can use
 * this form instead:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * new ECAction() { public void action() {
 * ...
 * }}.run();
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <ReturnType> The return type of the action.
