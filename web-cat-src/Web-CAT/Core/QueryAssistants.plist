 * assistant was used to construct a query). The value is a dictionary with
 * the following keys/values:
 *
 * entities: Optional. Value is an array of Strings that specify the entity
 *     types that this query assistant is valid for. If this key is not
 *     specified, then it is valid for all entities.
 *
 * modelName: Value is a String that specifies the fully-qualified name of the
 *     the class that represents the model that stores the state of this query
 *     assistant. This class must extend the
 *     org.webcat.core.objectquery.AbstractQueryAssistantModel interface
 *     and have a parameterless constructor.
 *
 * editorComponentName: Value is a String that specifies the full-qualified
 *     name of the WebObjects component that will be rendered to present this
 *     query assistant to the user for editing. This component must have the
 *     following bindings:
 *       - objectType: the type of object for which the query is being made
 *       - model: an instance of the class specified in modelName that
 *             represents the query internally for the model
 *
 * description: Value is a String that provides a description of the query
 *     assistant to the user. If this string contains a pipe '|' character,
 *     then the portion of the description before the pipe will be rendered as
 *     a hyperlink that the user can click to open that query assistant. If the
 *     string does not contain a pipe, then the entire string will be made into
 *     a link.
