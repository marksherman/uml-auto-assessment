<!-- This web.xml file by itself will allow you to run the corresponding
     WebObjects application in a Servlet container. If you would like to
     merge the WebObjects application with your existing JSP/Servlet
     application, you have to merge this web.xml with your existing web.xml.

     NOTE: This file is normally included as the template file 'web.xml.template'.
     During the build process, the placeholders for WOROOT, LOCALROOT, WOAINSTALLROOT,
     WOAppMode, WOClassPath, WOApplicationClass and WOtaglib will be replaced
     with the appropriate values. Other parts of the template file may be
     customized as required.

     NOTE: WEBINFROOT is added to the WOClassPath at build time, but the replacement
     value is replaced at runtime to be the path to the WEB-INF directory.
