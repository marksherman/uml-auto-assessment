Download the following libraries from their sources on the web and copy them
into this directory:

For OGNL support (required):
  * javassist.jar
  * ognl-2.7.3.jar

For Velocity template generation (required):
  * velocity-1.6.2.jar
  * commons-collections-3.2.1.jar
  * commons-lang-2.4.jar

You will also need an appropriate JSON library. To avoid requiring extraneous
dependencies, we recommend downloading the Java source files from
<http://www.JSON.org/java/index.html> and compiling them into a JAR named
"json.jar" in this directory.
