This assembly requires zip file support provided by
ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll. Download the DLL from
its source on the web (as of this writing,
http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib/)
and place it in this project directory.

You will also need to redistribute the SharpZipLib
assembly with the Web-CAT submitter assembly, if you
are using the submitter core assembly independently.
If you are using the Web-CAT submitter Visual Studio
integration package, this is automatically done for
you.
