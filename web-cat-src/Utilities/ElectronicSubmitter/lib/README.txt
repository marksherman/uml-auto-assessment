Required Libraries
==================

In order to build the Web-CAT Electronic Submitter, you will need to download
the following libraries and place them in the project's "lib" directory:

 * activation.jar (JavaBeans Activation Framework)
   http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javabeans/jaf/downloads/index.html

 * mail.jar (JavaMail)
   http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/downloads/index.html


These libraries are only required to be on the classpath at runtime if you plan
to use the mailto: protocol to submit files.
