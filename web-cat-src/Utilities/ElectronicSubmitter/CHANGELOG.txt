Web-CAT Electronic Submitter Version History
============================================

1.0.4 (2010-12-06):

 * Added support for Ant-style file patterns (using "**" for multiple
   directory matches) in the file inclusions, exclusions, and requirements.


1.0.3 (2010-11-04):

 * Internal change: SubmittableFile.getFilename() now always returns a
   relative path separated by "/" characters instead of the platform-
   dependent path separator.

 * The submitter no longer validates the submission targets with the
   XML schema, so that new attributes can be added by grading servers
   without breaking it for users who have older versions of the plug-in.


1.0.2 (2010-09-14):

 * Internal change: Calling `Submitter.setLongRunningTaskManager()` with a
   `null` argument is now a shortcut that reverts that instance of the
   submitter to the default long-running task behavior.

 * Added the ability to add arbitrary parameters to a `SubmissionManifest`
   using the `getParameter` and `setParameter` methods. These parameters can
   be recalled in transport URLs and transport parameters using the same
   `${x}` syntax that has previously been used for usernames, passwords, and
   assignment names.


1.0.1 (2010-05-14):

 * Internal change: Removed a reference to a chained exception constructor so
   that the submitter is source-compatible with Java 1.5, not just Java 1.6.


1.0.0 (2010-03-02):

 * Initial release. This library is a refactoring of the code that was
   previously part of the Eclipse submitter plug-ins, so that it can be used in
   other applications and environments.
