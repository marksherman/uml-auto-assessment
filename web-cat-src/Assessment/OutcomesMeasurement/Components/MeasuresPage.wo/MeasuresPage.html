<div dojoType="dijit.Dialog" id="dialog1" title="Examples of Measures">
  <p>Outcomes are <b>measured</b> by collecting scores that represent
  student performance on some task that is directly related to that
  outcome.</p>
  <p>Most often, these scores come from an assignment, a portion of an
  assignment, or portions of several assignments.</p>
  <p>Frequently, the scores on the measure are also used as part of the
  student's grade--that is, they come from graded work, and the measure
  is all or part of the earned grade for one or more assignments.  This
  is not mandatory, however--there is no <b>requirement</b> that measures
  you use for course or program objectives must come from some part of
  a student's grade.</p>
  <p>Frequently, measures are numeric--usually because they come from
  all or part of some assignment's score.  However, measures need not
  be numeric.  Categorical ratings driven by a written rubric or some
  other repeatable mechanism are also OK.</p>

  <h3>Good Examples of Measures</h3>
  <p>Suppose one course outcome is that students will be able to
  write programming control structures.  Homework assignments #2 and #3
  in your course focus exclusively on practice writing if statements,
  while loops, and for loops.  You decide to use the sum of the Homework
  #2 and #3 scores as your measure for this outcome.</p>
  <p>Suppose one course outcome is that students can use big-Oh analysis
  to characterize the running time of simple algorithms.  Question 8
  on the midterm and Questions 3 and 11 on the final exam all focus
  on this task.  You decide to use the sum of the scores on these three
  questions as your measure for this outcome.</p>
  <p>Suppose one course outcome is that students can communicate in
  writing effectively.  On a term project, you allocated 20% of the
  student grade for the quality of the writing, and you recorded
  how students scored for this portion of the assignment (not simply
  their total score on the assignment).  You decide to use each student's
  score on the writing quality portion of their term project as your
  measure for this outcome.</p>

  <h3>Bad Examples of Measures</h3>
  <p>Suppose one course outcome is that students will be able to write
  programming control structures.  Students were expected to use both
  if statements and loops in completing programming assignments #2 and #3.
  You decide to use the sum of their program #2 and #3 scores as your
  measure for this outcome.</p>
  <blockquote><b>Why is this a bad choice?</b> While students may have used control
  structures to write solutions to these two assignments, the total grade
  on the assignments is likely based on many other factors, rather than
  just on whether or not they used control structures correctly.  If their
  total program score also includes judgements about their overall program
  design, the quality of their comments, their ability to produce the
  correct output, whether they turned their work in on time, the elegance
  of their solution, etc., then the overall scores on the assignments
  conflates all of these dimensions into one number.  If they receive
  a 70% on such an assignment, it isn't possible to tease apart what
  that single number says about their design, their comments, their
  time management, their ability to read an assignment description, ...
  or their mastery of basic control constructs.</blockquote>
  <p>Suppose one course outcome is that students can use big-Oh analysis
  to characterize the running time of simple algorithms.  Question 8
  on the midterm and Questions 3 and 11 on the final exam all focus
  on this task.  You decide to use the sum of the scores on these two
  tests as your measure for this outcome.</p>
  <blockquote><b>Why is this a bad choice?</b> As with the previous
  example, using the total test scores conflates performance on all the
  other questions--which may be focused on completely different
  topics--into one number.  While that number may be an aggregate indicator
  of overall performance on many goals, it does not give much direct
  insight into the outcome of interest here.</blockquote>
  <p>Suppose one course outcome is that students can communicate in
  writing effectively.  On a term project, students had to write a
  final report and then present it orally in class.  The grade for
  the project was based primarily on technical content, and was
  judged on the presentation and report together.  You decide to use
  each student's final project grade as your
  measure for this outcome.</p>
  <blockquote><b>Why is this a bad choice?</b> Despite the fact that
  writing effort was involved, if student scores were not based on
  their ability to communicate in writing effectively, those scores do
  not relate to achievement of this outcome.  Further, the project score
  conflates a number of dimensions of performance into a single number,
  losing any detail about student performance regarding written
  communication.</blockquote>

<div dojoType="dijit.Dialog" id="dialog2" title="Explanation of Performance Levels">
  <p>For each outcome measured in your
  course, student achievement is broken into three
  categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><b>Excellent</b>: the student applies the knowledge or
    skills with virtually no procedural or conceptual errors.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Adequate</b>: the student applies the knowledge or skills,
    but may make minor procedural errors or occasional conceptual
    errors.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Unsatisfactory</b>: the student makes significant conceptual
    and/or procedural errors when attempting to apply the knowledge or
    skills.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Course learning objective measures are reported in terms of
  <b>the number of students achieving the goal at each level</b>.</p>
  <p><b>You are responsible</b> for defining how student performance
  is partitioned into these three categories for your measure--it
  depends heavily on the nature of your specifics.  Nominally, we
  suggest that Excellent correspond to &gt;= 90% performance,
  with Adequate corresponding to &gt;= 60% performance, and
  Unsatsifactory corresponding to anything lower.  If your situation
  warrants, however, you can define the cutoffs yourself.</p>
  <p>
  Also, note that if you use a categorical measure (say, from a
  rubric), you will need to define your own categorical criteria
  for partitioning student performance into these three categories.

<div dojoType="dijit.Dialog" id="dialog3" title="How to Describe Measures">
  <p>Outcomes are <b>measured</b> by collecting scores that represent
  student performance on some task that is directly related to that
  outcome.</p>
  <p>Most often, these scores come from an assignment, a portion of an
  assignment, or portions of several assignments.</p>
  <p>To describe which assignments you used, give a brief description of
  what student work or scores you used for this.  For example:</p>
  <blockquote>
  "midterm questions 14-17", or<br/>
  "HW#3 scores", or<br/>
  "design scores on program 5", or<br/>
  whatever you used ...
