Source code for the Student-Library is available from <http://web-cat.org>
or from SourceForge <http://web-cat.sf.net/>.

The student.jar file also includes the compiled class files for abbot,
a separate open-source project <http://abbot.sourceforge.net>.  Abbot
is available separately under the Common Public License
<http://abbot.sourceforge.net/doc/CPL.html>.

The Student-Library includes a couple of minor patches to abbot.  As a
result, the student.jar file includes the abbot class files so that only
student.jar needs be on the class path and classpath ordering conflicts
can be avoided.  If you are using student.jar, there is no need to include
abbot.jar on the classpath.  If abbot.jar is included, it should be later
on the classpath, so that the patches in student.jar will take precedence.
