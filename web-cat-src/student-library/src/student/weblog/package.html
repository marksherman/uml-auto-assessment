<title>student.weblog Package Summary</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
This package provides all of the course-specific classes based
on the web log analyzer example from Chapter 4
of <i>Objects First with Java</i> by Michael Kolling
and David Barnes.  These classes support program assignments
where students write their own web log analysis programs, using
real Apache log data from a live server (in this case, typically from
our departmental server).
</p>
<p>
The primary differences between the classes in this package and those
discussed in the <i>B&amp;K</i> text are:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The <code>LogEntry</code> class provides access to time information
    using the <code>java.util.Calendar</code> class, and that it also
    provides other information about each log entry (the URL being
    requested, the result code sent back to the requester, the browser
    being used, and so on).</p>
<li><p>The <code>LogReader</code> class, which corresponds to the
    <i>B&amp;K</i> <code>LogfileReader</code> class, is designed to
    work on a <code>BufferedReader</code> input stream.</p>
</ol>
