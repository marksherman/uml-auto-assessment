<title>student.adventure Package Summary</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
This package provides all of the course-specific classes based
on the "World of Zuul" adventure game example from Chapter 7
of <i>Objects First with Java</i> by Michael Kolling
and David Barnes.  These classes support program assignments
where students write their own adventure games by adding to and
extending these core classes.
</p>
<p>
The primary differences between the classes in this package and those
discussed in the <i>B&amp;K</i> text are:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The <code>Command</code> objects use polymorphism
    (object-oriented dispatch) for controlling execution of
    the proper behavior, rather than a series of if statements as in
    the textbook (see exercise 7.39 in the text).</p>
<li><p>The <code>Game</code> class is abstract, and cannot be
    played directly.  Instead, one must create a subclass and define
    three abstract methods to produce a playable game.</p>
<li><p>The classes in this package have been designed so that one
    can implement a game and extend all necessary features by
    appropriate subclassing and overriding.  As a result, these
    classes are distributed in binary form only.  This contrasts with
    the scenario in the text, where students directly modify the
    source code of these classes.</p>
