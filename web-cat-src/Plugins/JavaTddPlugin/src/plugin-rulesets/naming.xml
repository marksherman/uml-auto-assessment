  <description>
    The Naming Ruleset contains a collection of rules about names -
    too long, too short, and so forth.  This version of the ruleset
    includes alternate messages from the main PMD rulesets/naming.xml
    ruleset.

  <!-- rule ref="rulesets/naming.xml/LongVariable"
    message="The variable name ''{0}'' seems a little longer than
    necessary. It is important to use descriptive names, but
    excessively long variable names can increase typing errors. Try to
    find a slightly shorter (less than 17 characters) but still
    descriptive variable name."/ -->

     <!--
     ShortVariable
     -->

  <rule ref="rulesets/naming.xml/ShortMethodName"
    message="The name of this method is probably not very
    descriptive. Using descriptive method names (at least three
    characters) makes it easier for a reader to understand what the
    method is supposed to do."/>

     <!--
     SuspiciousHashcodeMethodName
     -->

  <rule ref="rulesets/naming.xml/AvoidNonConstructorMethodsWithClassName"
    message="This method has the same name as the class that contains
    it.  Did you intend this method to be a constructor? If so,
    remember constructors do not have a return type. If not, you
    should pick a new name for this method."/>

  <rule ref="rulesets/naming.xml/AvoidFieldNameMatchingTypeName"
    message="This field has the same name as the class that contains
    it. This is not illegal but it can be very confusing and is best
    avoided. You should pick a new name for this field."/>
