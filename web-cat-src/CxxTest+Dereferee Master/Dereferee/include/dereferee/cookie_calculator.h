// ===========================================================================
/**
 * A lowest-common-denominator implementation of the cookie calculator that
 * determines the size by faux-allocating a one-element array of type T but
 * throwing an exception before construction occurs to prevent side-effects.
 * Until the TR1 type traits extensions in C++0x are properly and
 * consistently implemented in more compilers, this is the safest and most
 * correct way to compute the cookie size.
 *
 * Since this scheme requires the use of a new-expression, this prevents the
 * use of cookie_calculator for types that do not implement a parameterless
 * constructor. This normally would not pose a problem since one cannot
 * allocate an array of such objects anyway, but it forces us to restrict
 * using the cookie calculator in those checked_ptr<> operators that would
 * only be used in an array context (arithmetic and indexing), or else such
 * classes would not be able to be used with any checked pointers, array or
 * not.
 *
 * The above means that the cookie calculation will be done only "on demand",
 * upon the first arithmetic or indexing usage. No errors should slip by due
 * to this, however, because those are the only ways for a pointer to move
 * out of bounds -- dereferencing a live pointer that hasn't been
 * arithmetically modified is known to be safe because it must point to the
 * beginning of its block.
 *
 * This scheme will fail to compile in the special case where you allocate an
 * array of derived objects (with a parameterless constructor) but assign it
 * to a pointer of the base type (without a parameterless constructor), like
 * so:
 *
 *    class Base { public: Base(...) { } };
 *    class Derived : public Base { public: Derived() : Base(...) { } };
 *    checked(Base*) p = new Derived[n];
 *
 * It would also fail in the event that Base is an abstract class. However,
 * both of these situations are ill-advised because they do not provide
 * proper polymorphism and would only work properly in the event that the
 * both Base and Derived were the same size in memory.
