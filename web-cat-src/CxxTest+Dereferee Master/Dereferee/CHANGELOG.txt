DEREFEREE: Checked Pointer Usage in C++
=======================================

Version: 1.1.2 (10/10/2009)

* gcc_macosx_platform has been updated to support 64-bit architectures.

Version: 1.1.1 (9/9/2008)

* gcc_bfd_platform has been updated to support 64-bit architectures.

Version: 1.1.0 (8/24/2008)

* The demo application has been overhauled to be a more substantial
  demonstration of Dereferee's features. It is now an interactive console
  application. See the demo/README file for more information.

* Listeners have been refactored to separate platform-specific functionality
  for backtracing from the error reporting. Backtrace-related functions are
  now found in the Dereferee::platform abstract class, and removed from
  Dereferee::listener. See the README file for updated instructions on
  building the library, specifically the LISTENER and PLATFORM makefile
  variables.

* Checked pointers to classes without any parameterless constructor could
  not be properly instantiated by the compiler in some cases, due to how
  arrays and pointer arithmetic must be handled. This has been fixed.

* const_cast support had been accidentally left out of the unchecked variant
  of the checked_ptr<> template.

* Added methods to the platform interface that allow external libraries to
  save and restore the backtrace context (useful for crash recovery and unit
  testing frameworks), for those platforms (such as gcc_*) that keep track
  of the backtrace in real time.

* Added helper functions Dereferee::current_platform and
  Dereferee::current_listener that allow external libraries to interact with
  these objects directly.

* Fixed the line number comments in tests/wont_compile_tests.h.

* Two more unit test suites have been added to ensure the correct behavior
  when checked pointers are used with abstract classes and classes that do
  not implement a parameterless constructor.

KNOWN ISSUES:
* The new_operator_tests/new_throw_overflow test case may fail on Mac OS X
  systems if the malloc debugging features are enabled. This is acceptable and
  does not represent a failure of Dereferee or the testing suite.
