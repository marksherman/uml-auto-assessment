Dereferee interactive demo
==========================
This demo application is provided to give users a quick look at the enhanced
diagnostics that Dereferee offers.

The application displays a list of memory errors that you can choose to
induce. After making a selection, the lines of code that will be executed
will be displayed, and then they will be executed. Any errors or warnings
that are generated will be displayed, along with a stack trace that shows
the context of the error.

Some of the choices in the demo induce unrecoverable errors. After Dereferee
prints the error diagnostic, in some cases it has no alternative but to
attempt the operation (for example, the dereferencing of a pointer inside
an expression). Any raised signal that you may see during the demo as a
result of this is normal and does not represent a bug in the demo. If the
error was not fatal, you will see a memory usage report before the demo
application exits.

The source code for this demo can be found in pretty-printed interactive
form at <http://www.web-cat.org/>.
