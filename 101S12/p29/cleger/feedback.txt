Your program did not compile as submitted. There were multiple compiler errors based on the same ine, the creation of a static const array of return values. I repeat: THE PROGRAM DID NOT COMPILE AS SUBMITTED.

When I removed the "static const" qualifiers from line 58, it worked fine. 

My question to you: why did you make it static and const? These keywords bring properties that make your code not work. I can't imagine that was intentional. How did you come up with this idea?

Also, your file name was p29a.c, and not the expected p29.c or rpslk.c. 

With the fix, your program was fine, so 5/6.
